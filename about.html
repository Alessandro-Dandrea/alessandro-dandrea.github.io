        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I've extensive experience in SEO, some in online advertising and I'm a passionate rookie in product management.</p>
        <p>In pure, cold numbers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>8ish years of experience in SEO.</li>
            <li>More than 3 years of experience in Google Ads, Bing Ads, Meta Ads and LinkedIn Ads.</li>
            <li>More than 1 year of experience as Product Owner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've had huge successes in SEO(???) thanks to my super assistants:</p>
        <p>Finferlo, Castagna and Nespola. Pics are scheduled for the next commit.</p>
