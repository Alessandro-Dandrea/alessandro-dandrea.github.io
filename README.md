# Alessandro D'Andrea's testing website

Hey Github pals!
This is just a very raw website created directly using GitHub pages.
I don't need a super fancy dynamic website since I've already a Substack in Italian, one in English and my super LinkedIn account.
So this is just a project I've set up a Saturday night instead of watching anime.
Yes, I enjoy having boring Saturday afternoons....
